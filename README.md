# Quiz App

This is a Quiz App I made using useContext, useState, hooks etc. Basically i tried experimenting the whole manipulation in ReactJS. This Project was actually from a YT tutorial where he used only useState and useContext but i furthermore thought of another approach to this project. It thought me alot about the concept of useContext, hopefully i'd be making another project using them and other reactJS based context.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
